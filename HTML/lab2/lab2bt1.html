<p>If you're lucky or connected you can get an invite,sans the price tag.But I wasn't
so lucky or connected my first 2 years so I'm here to help you out.Firsr,plan out which shows are most important to you and make a schedule and this is a biggie:
SET A BUDGET.If you're worring about blowing your cash the whole time you
won't have fun.Then check out prices,days,and times and prioritize the designers
you want to see most.Lastly,purchase your tickets and get excited!</p>

<p>Always be true to your own sense of style,if you don't you'll be uncomfortable the whole time and it will show.Remember,NYFW is about expressing yourself and
talking in what the designers have chosen to express throught their new lines.Also
it's important to wear shoes you'll be comfortable in all day.Obviously you want yo
look good but you'l be on your feet all day long so be prepare</p>
